                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Infinite Worlds is an exploration of play and creativity through an infinite world generated by code. It's a place where I can make my mark, in both a literal and figurative sense, experimenting with ideas and techniques. Every click creates something new in this world â€” a tiny change that ripples outward, shaping the environment around it.</p>
                    
                    <p>The ethereal quality of the virtual world is enhanced by its unpredictability. I never know exactly what will happen when I add or remove or modify texture, color, shape. The malleable nature of the landscape allowed me to create intriguing patterns that have depth and movement.</p>

                    <p>This particular world was inspired by a visit to Minneapolis after a winter storm. I realized flying in over Minnesota that the northern Midwest is a land of ephemeral lakes. </p>
                    
                    <p>This project represents a confluence between art-making and technology; it explores how we interact with digital spaces to express ourselves creatively without limitations. Infinite Worlds invites participants to question how randomness generates order in our natural environment while inspiring playful experimentation.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I utilize a combination of procedural generation algorithms to create a dynamically evolving virtual landscape. The core of the experiment lies in the unique hash value generated from user interactions seeds the procedural algorithms. Using the XXH32 hashing function and p5.js's built-in noiseSeed and randomSeed methods, each input generates a distinct visual output on a grid of tiles. Each tile, depending on its hashed value, displays different shades and shapes, responding to clicks by altering its appearance and opacity. The technical architecture is designed to mimic infinite possibilities within a contained digital ecosystem, allowing each user's journey through the landscape to be unique and personal. The setup leverages JavaScript's flexibility and the p5.js library's graphical capabilities to render a responsive and interactive artistic piece.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This one was much easier since I'd completed it earlier when I designed the course.</p>
