                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>We're trying to replicate the landscape on the left procedurally.  Or at least suggest relevant parts of it.</p>
                    <p>We begin our creative journey with a simple concept: a horizontal line set across the canvas.</p>
                    <p>In this experiment, I embarked on a journey to transform a simple digital canvas into a dynamic and textured landscape using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding. The project began with the rendering of a basic horizontal line across the canvas, serving as a foundational element for further visual experimentation. To infuse realism and variability into this static line, I integrated Perlin noise, which allowed me to modulate the line with a naturalistic texture. This noise-enhanced line was then scaled to depict the undulating silhouette of a distant horizon, reminiscent of Monument Valley's iconic skyline.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>

                <p>Further elaborating on this textured horizon, I introduced a cutoff threshold. This algorithmic intervention transformed portions of the textured line that exceeded this threshold into mesas, defining the nascent stages of a layered landscape. Subsequently, the tops of these mesas were given additional texture to enhance their three-dimensional appearance. The heights of the mesas were randomized using noise functions to avoid uniformity and simulate natural variability.</p>

                <p>To augment the landscape's complexity, I devised a method to define intricate shapes that could be programmatically filled, thus creating a more detailed and engaging visual representation. A textured horizon was added, along with a dynamically generated sky. This sky was populated with animated clouds, the colors of which were derived from a reference photograph, ensuring that the palette resonated with natural hues observed in real-world scenarios.</p>

                <p>Importantly, the use of Perlin noise, rather than random functions, was instrumental throughout this development process. Unlike random functions that generate abrupt, discrete values, Perlin noise produces continuous, smooth variations. This characteristic is critical for simulating the subtle and fluid changes typical of natural environments, thereby enhancing the realism and visual continuity of the animated landscape. This procedural approach not only enriched the visual aesthetics but also demonstrated the potential of noise functions in generating complex, lifelike digital art.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Working on this example experiment for students started as a brief quickie example and turned into a 6-hour code binge. My eyes hurt.</p>
                <p>If I had time and energy, I would still add texture to the ground and all sorts of things.</p>
